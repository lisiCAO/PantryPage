### Laravel Logging Configuration Guide

This guide provides instructions for configuring the logging system in a Laravel project. Follow these steps to set up and customize logging as per your project's requirements.

#### 1. Environment Configuration

In your `.env` file, set up the following environment variables:

- `LOG_CHANNEL`: This determines the primary channel for logging. Common options are `stack`, `single`, `daily`, `slack`, etc.
- `LOG_LEVEL`: This sets the minimum level of logs that will be recorded. Options include `debug`, `info`, `notice`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`, `alert`, and `emergency`.

Example:
```
LOG_CHANNEL=daily
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

#### 2. Editing `config/logging.php`

Open the `config/logging.php` file to define or modify log channels.

- **Stack Channel**:
  If using `stack`, specify which channels it should stack:
  ```php
  'stack' => [
      'driver' => 'stack',
      'channels' => ['single', 'slack'],
      'ignore_exceptions' => false,
  ],
  ```

- **Custom Channels**:
  Define custom channels based on your project's needs. For example:
  ```php
  'admin' => [
      'driver' => 'daily',
      'path' => storage_path('logs/admin.log'),
      'level' => 'debug',
  ],
  ```

#### 3. Using the Log in Your Application

Import the Log facade in your PHP files:
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
```

Log an entry:
```php
Log::info('This is an informational message.');
```

For specific channels:
```php
Log::channel('admin')->error('This is an error in the admin panel.');
```

#### 4. Log Rotation

For channels using the `daily` driver, logs will be rotated daily. You can specify the number of days to retain the logs by adding a `days` attribute:
```php
'daily' => [
    'driver' => 'daily',
    'path' => storage_path('logs/laravel.log'),
    'level' => 'debug',
    'days' => 14,
],
```

#### 5. Security Considerations

- Avoid logging sensitive data like passwords or personal user information.
- Regularly monitor and archive log files to manage disk space.

#### 6. Advanced Configuration

For advanced logging needs, you can create custom channels using different handlers provided by Monolog.

#### Conclusion

This configuration guide should help you and your team set up a robust logging system for your Laravel project. Make sure to adjust the settings as per your project's specific needs and environment.
