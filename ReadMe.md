The admin panel of the "recipe" project has faced delays and chaos during development due to factors such as frequent refactoring, uncertain technology stack, and evolving requirements. Now, it's time to reorganize and prepare for a refactor.

To refactor the project, we will embark on a structured learning and development plan. This plan will be divided into several parts: learning essential technologies, project planning, environment setup, development, testing, and deployment. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Learning Phase

1. **HTML & Sass**:
   - As you already have some knowledge of Sass, practice by creating simple projects like a static webpage.
   - Improve your skills using resources such as the Sass official documentation and online tutorials.

2. **React**:
   - Start with React's official documentation, learn fundamentals like JSX, components, state, and lifecycle.
   - Complete introductory tutorials, like creating a ToDo application.
   - Learn React Router, which is valuable for building Single Page Applications (SPAs).

3. **Laravel (PHP framework)**:
   - Laravel offers excellent documentation and tutorials. Begin with the basics: routing, controllers, views, and models.
   - Learn how to interact with databases using Eloquent ORM.
   - Understand how to perform form validation in Laravel.

4. **Docker**:
   - Since you're already familiar with Docker, learn how to create Docker containers for your development environment.

5. **GitHub Actions & AWS**:
   - Learn how to use GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows.
   - Gain knowledge of AWS services, especially those related to continuous deployment, such as AWS CodeDeploy, Elastic Beanstalk, or EC2.

### Project Planning

1. **Requirements Analysis**:
   - Define project requirements and goals.
   - Outline user stories and functionalities for the admin panel.

2. **Database Design**:
   - Design the MySQL database schema.
   - Create tables and relationships for recipes, users, ingredients, and reviews.

3. **UI/UX Design**:
   - Create wireframes and design mockups.
   - Write styles using Sass to maintain UI consistency.

4. **Technical Architecture**:
   - Decide on the interaction between the front-end and back-end, such as implementing a REST API.

### Environment Setup

1. **Local Development Environment**:
   - Use Docker to set up your local development environment, including PHP, MySQL, and any other required services.
   - Configure a local React development environment.

2. **Version Control**:
   - Set up a new repository on GitHub.
   - Ensure that your Docker environment and all code are committed.

### Development Phase

1. **Backend Development**:
   - Build API endpoints using Laravel.
   - Implement user authentication, data validation, and error handling.

2. **Frontend Development**:
   - Construct UI components using React.
   - Implement communication with the backend API.

3. **Frontend-Backend Integration**:
   - Ensure that the frontend correctly displays data sent by the backend.
   - Implement CRUD operations.

### Testing Phase

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for the Laravel backend.
   - Write tests for React components.

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the smooth integration between the frontend and backend.

### Deployment Phase

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment using GitHub Actions.
   - Ensure automatic deployment to AWS after code submission.

2. **AWS Environment**:
   - Configure AWS services to run and manage your application.
   - Set up the database and any required storage services.

### Maintenance Phase

1. **Monitoring**:
   - Establish monitoring and logging to track performance and issues in the production environment.

2. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Continuously adjust and improve the application based on user feedback.

By following these steps, you will systematically learn essential technologies, plan and develop your project, and deploy it to the production environment. Each step requires time and effort, so patience and continuous learning are crucial.
